# New Joiners Guide

Doc contract:

- Purpose: Define onboarding expectations and local setup steps.
- Owner: platform
- Status: living
- Review cadence: 90d
- Related: docs/onboarding/13_COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md, docs/20-contracts/02_PLATFORM_BOUNDARIES.md, docs/40-delivery/38_BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md

This guide outlines the minimum setup expected for contributors to GoldenPath IDP.

## Required setup

- Install the project tooling listed in `docs/onboarding/13_COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md`.
- Review the day-one checklist in `docs/onboarding/25_DAY_ONE_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Review the platform/team boundary in `docs/20-contracts/02_PLATFORM_BOUNDARIES.md`.
- Initialize your local environment:

```bash
bin/governance setup
```

## Before your first PR

- Run all hooks and linters locally to validate your setup:

```bash
bin/governance lint
```

- Fix any issues reported by the tools before opening a PR.
- Use `scripts/scaffold_doc.py` for any new docs; pre-commit will auto-fix headers if needed.
- Review PR gates and how to unblock them in `docs/onboarding/24_PR_GATES.md`.
- Review AI agent protocols in `docs/onboarding/26_AI_AGENT_PROTOCOLS.md` (these rules apply to human collaborators too).
- **Internalize VQ**: Your first task is to read [**VQ Principles & Philosophy**](../product/VQ_PRINCIPLES.md) and identify the VQ bucket (**🔴 HV/HQ**, etc.) for your first contribution.

## Expectations (The Value Provider Mindset)

We don't just "commit code" here; we **reclaim time**.

- **Value-Led PRs**: Every PR you open is expected to include a VQ classification in the PR body. This ensures we focus on high-impact work and avoid over-engineering low-value targets.
- **Pre-commit hooks** are required for local commits.
- **CI remains the source of truth**; hooks are the fast preflight gate.
- **Merge Path**: PRs merge into `development` first; `main` only accepts merges from `development`.

## The Prevention Mindset

At GoldenPath, we don't just fix problems - we prevent them from recurring.

**When you encounter an issue:**

1. Fix it (unblock yourself)
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. Ask "How do I ensure this never happens again?"
4. Implement the prevention
5. Document both

**Hot fixes without prevention are considered incomplete work.**

This applies to both humans and AI agents. See
`docs/governance/GOV-0034-ai-agent-governance.md` Section 10 for the full mandate.

## Branching and PR flow

- Create branches from `development`.
- Open PRs into `development`.
- Only `development` is allowed to merge into `main`.

## Skip policy

Bypass hooks only for urgent fixes, then run the hooks in a follow-up commit.
Document the reason in the PR.

```text
SKIP=hook-id git commit
```

## Need help?

Ask in the platform team channel or open an issue with the exact error output.
